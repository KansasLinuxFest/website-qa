website-qa
==========

a repo for testing the pelican website before publishing it on website

This is added as a submodule to the website project in the pelican branch as the output dir
https://github.com/KansasLinuxFest/website/tree/pelican

then we rune the html generation into the output dir which lands in this repo.
